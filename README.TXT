breakout-lab project

The breakout-lab code creates the breakout game, but without any bricks.
The lab class exercise (with tutor support) is to add a row of bricks and make them
disappear when the ball hits them. 

There are three places marked in the files where you need to add code to make this work:

[1] in Model, where you create an array of GameObj onjects for the bricks 
[2] in View, where you make drawPicture display the bricks
[3] in Model, where you make bricks 'disappear' (and the bat bounce off) when 
    the bat hits them 

breakout-solution includes the code to do this

The assessment project uses breakout-solution as the starting point for adding
new features as discussed in lectures and seminars. Tutors may not help directly 
with this but will talk you through examples and answer questions.
